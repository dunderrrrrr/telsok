# Scraperr

Scraperr is a self-hosted web application that allows users to scrape data from web pages by specifying elements via XPath. Users can submit URLs and the corresponding elements to be scraped, and the results will be displayed in a table.

From the table, users can download a csv of the job's results, along with an option to rerun the job.

## Features

- Submit URLs for web scraping
- Add and manage elements to scrape using XPath
- Display results of scraped data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jaypyles/scraperr.git

   ```

2. Create `.env` file.

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@webscrape-mongo:27017
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=600
HOSTNAME="localhost"
HOSTNAME_DEV="localhost"
```

Change `HOSTNAME` from localhost to your domain, if deploying this through traefik publicly.

3. Deploy

```sh
make up
```

The app provides its own `traefik` configuration to use independently, but can easily be reverse-proxied by any other app, or your own reverse-proxy.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost`.
2. Enter the URL you want to scrape in the URL field.
3. Add elements to scrape by specifying a name and the corresponding XPath.
4. Click the "Submit" button to start the scraping process.
5. The results will be displayed in the "Results" section.
