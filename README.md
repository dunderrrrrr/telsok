## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

All you need to do to play around locally with TelS√∂k is to create two `env` files. When done, run `make start`.

- `.env`
  - This holds only the Google API key. It's not required, but Google search will be disabled if not set.
  ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=yOuR_kEy
  ```
- `scraper/.env`
  - Use defaults from [jaypyles/Scraperr](https://github.com/jaypyles/Scraperr).
  ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@webscrape-mongo:27017
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    ALGORITHM=HS256
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=600
    HOSTNAME="localhost"
    HOSTNAME_DEV="localhost"
  ```
